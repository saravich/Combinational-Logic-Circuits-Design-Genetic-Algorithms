    "<br>**GENETIC ALGORITHM**<font color='violet'></br>\n",
    "<br>Genetic algorithm is an approach to find the fittest solution of problems inspired by Charles Darwin's theory of natural evolution. The algorithm uses the process of natural selection where the individuals as members of a population, which are usualy of great size, who best satisfy the given conditions are most likely to be chosen to generate the next generation. Hence the next generation is born with more satisfactory characteristics than the previous one and this process continues untill an individual is born which satisfies all conditions given or is best suited to fit a set of data. \n",
    "Five concepts needs to be defined in this approach:</font></br><font color='blue'>\n",
    "1. initial population : It's a set of individuals which are normally chosen by random and hence they are most likely to be different in characteristics. In this problem population members are circuits which consist of a, to some extent, unique combination of logic gates.\n",
    "    \n",
    "2. chromosome (DNA):Each individual in a given population. Each DNA is a combination of the logic gates given.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Genes : Each DNA/chromosome cosists of characteristics which have combined together, in different types or different sequences, to form a DNA. In the given problem each gene could be one of the logic gates from the list {'AND','OR','NAND','NOR','XOR','XNOR'}.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. selection : As in the Darwinian theory of slelection, individuals with more favorable characteristics are more likely to survive. Hence, we should give the DNAs wich better suit the data a higher chance to be chosen to produce the next generation. On the other hand, we shall not neglect other individuals as they might also have favorable characteristics which may contribute to the evolution of a more satisfying generation. The approach to select the parents to mate is to be explained:\n",
    "        1. We choose a random member of the present population \n",
    "        2. We choose a random number in (=0,sum of fitness of the whole population)\n",
    "        3. If the fitness value of the chosen member is less than the fitness value which we picked by chance, the member is validated to be a parent. This way we give members a chance of being selected proportional to their fitness value.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. crossover: When two parents are selected by the previous approach, we choose a random number from (=0,length of DNA) as the midpoint and create two instances of new DNAs as children to which genes of first parents are assigned to before (first child) and after (second child) the midpoint.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. mutation: after each child has been created, each child's genes begin to change randomly regarding to a mutation possibility given. This possibility should be low as we don't want our child deviate from their parents' favorable characteristics that much.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. fitness : Fitness for each DNA is defined as the 2 to the power of the number of data sets the DNA can perfectly match given the inputs and the desired output (this number is named as DNA's score). With this choice of fitness function we are able to exaggerate the distinction between a regular DNA and a more favorable one.\n",
    "</font>\n",
    "And done. The population continues to evolve and change do to the reproduction. \n",
    "Further explanation of the code is to be given in the next section."
